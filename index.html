                <p>You are a model in disguise who deserves king-level photography!</p>
                <p>My name is Jacob and I currently live in Uppsala, Sweden. I was born and raised in Africa. After
                    moving to a totally different country, I decided to open my eyes to discover many things such as new
                    people, small and big creatures in nature, the 4 distinct seasons, technology e.t.c.
                </p>
                <p>Through this journey I also discovered photography. Photography is such an amazing art that helps us
                    to capture moments that otherwise would have only been captured in one's heart. If not
                    photographically captured, they will then be desperately narrated to be painted in the
                    listener's heart. Photography bypasses all this hustle and downloads these beautiful moments into
                    other's hearts
                    within seconds. Isn't that amazing? Good job Louis Le Prince and Johann Zahn!
                </p>
                <p>I have been doing photography for a couple of years now and I can say it is one of the few things
                    that I really enjoy doing today. I was normally a guy who spent a lot of time sitting at home in
                    front of a computer or just doing some house chores. Yes those unavoidable chores are annoying,
                    arent they? However, after I started picking up my camera it has forced me to go out in nature, take
                    long walks, observe and appreciate what is around me. Birds differnt types of insects, dogs are some
                    of the few things that I have been discovering and photographing. I would have never done all those
                    things had it not been for my camera. I have also met several good people though it. What an amazing
                    journey?!
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the genres of photography that I really like is portrait photography. This type of
                    photography is so flexible it can be done in a studio, in nature, at home, in the kitchen basically
                    almost anywhere. I love adding values to people's lives by taking portraits pictures for them and
                    seeing them happy afterwards.

                <p>Everyone is a model in disguise who deserves king-level photography!</p>
                <p>Let's meet up
                    and take some king-level portraits of you, shall we?</p>
